# Metabolic Syndrome Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the presence of metabolic syndrome using machine learning models. The dataset was preprocessed, analyzed, and modeled to identify key predictors and evaluate the performance of logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest classifiers.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains health-related measurements and categorical data. These variables are linked to factors contributing to metabolic syndrome, including obesity, blood glucose levels, lipid profile, and demographic attributes. Key features include:

- **Age**: Patient age.  
- **Gender**: Male or female.  
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: Indicator of body fat based on weight and height.  
- **Waist Circumference**: Measurement of abdominal obesity.  
- **Triglycerides**: Blood fat levels.  
- **HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein)**: "Good cholesterol."  
- **Blood Glucose**: Blood sugar levels.  
- **Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure**: Blood pressure measurements.  
- **Metabolic Syndrome**: Target variable indicating the presence or absence of the condition.

The data was analyzed and engineered to improve its predictive power. Missing values were handled appropriately, and the predictors were selected based on exploratory analysis and model performance.
